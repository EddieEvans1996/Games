# Games

This repo is where I place any games that I create. May be compiled into a single GUI at some point in the future.

- CHESS \
This game is now complete, although is likely to have lots of bugs! My code probably isn't the cleanest code compared to a seasoned developer.
The aim is now to create AI to play against. The aim is to try and use the machine learning I learnt once upon a time to make something that beats me at chess
(this is not a difficult task knowing how bad I am at chess).
